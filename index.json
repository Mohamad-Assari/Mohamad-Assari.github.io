A representative sample is one which preserve important properties of the graph. Graph sampling becomes more important when original Graph is massive. There is no perfect sample that can preserve all the properties of the original graph, so we should find the most appropriate one that can preserve the important properties for domain-specific goals.\nI am currently working on this project and It is not completely finished yet.\n","date":1565997874,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565997874,"objectID":"3d3f5734b989edc695fc069602184c3b","permalink":"/project/graphsampling/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T03:54:34+04:30","relpermalink":"/project/graphsampling/","section":"project","summary":"Graph sampling from distance matrices using Spanning trees and visualization of closeness and betweenness in graph","tags":["spanning-tree","visualization","python","networkx","numpy"],"title":"Graph Sampling Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mohamad Assari"],"categories":[],"content":"A simple CamScanner implemented with python using OpenCV library\nYou can review my code in my github account.\n","date":1565997857,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565997857,"objectID":"51e3859d3cd34386631a98df130356aa","permalink":"/project/camscanner/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T03:54:17+04:30","relpermalink":"/project/camscanner/","section":"project","summary":"A simple CamScanner","tags":["complexity","Algorithm"],"title":"CamScanner","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mohamad Assari"],"categories":[],"content":"This is my Project 2 of Advanced Programming course at Amirkabir University of Technology.\nDesign and Implementation of Pacman game using multithreading\nYou can review my code in my github account.\n","date":1565997857,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565997857,"objectID":"79d32365a8f1ab2bd7a5b2e427169784","permalink":"/project/pacman/","publishdate":"2019-08-17T03:54:17+04:30","relpermalink":"/project/pacman/","section":"project","summary":"A 2D Pacman game implemented with java.
