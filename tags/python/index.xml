      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph sampling from distance matrices using Spanning trees(minimum spanning tree, maximum spanning tree, low weighted and high weighted random walk spanning trees) and visualization of average shortest path, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality in these graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was developed using some python libraries such as networkx, numpy and graphviz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of graph sampling is to construct smaller sub graph from large graph which
is representative. A representative sample is one which preserve important properties of the graph.
Graph sampling becomes more important when original Graph is massive. There is no
perfect sample that can preserve all the properties of the original graph, so we should find the
most appropriate one that can preserve the important properties for domain-specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on this project and It is not completely finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;
